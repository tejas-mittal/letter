        <h1>My Dearest Aakansha </h1>
        <p>
          I may be 1,900+ km away from you right now, but let these words wrap
          around you like the warmth of my arms. You came into my life like a
          soft melody, unexpected and unforgettable. Since that moment, my days
          have felt brighter, lighter, and filled with a joy I never knew I
          needed. Your laughter—so pure and carefree, like a child’s—wraps
          around my heart and makes everything feel right. You have this way of
          making life feel simpler, calmer, like a deep breath in the middle of
          a storm. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I think you are close to understanding the true meaning of
          life—letting others talk without bothering yourself, enjoying every
          second of it without dwelling too much on the past or worrying about
          the future, staying true to your heart, and never hurting others in
          any way. Most importantly, you value making real heart-to-heart
          connections in this fake, social media-dominated world, where such
          qualities are rapidly disappearing. You have an exceptional talent for
          creating mandala art that I absolutely adore—it effortlessly takes my
          heart away. In many ways, I see you as a reflection of these values,
          resonating with the same essence as myself.
          <br>
          <br>
          At the end of the day, you
          will always be my girl and  <b>I am in love with you</b>  So, here I am, asking you from the deepest
          corner of my heart: Will you let me spend the days ahead loving you
          making them most?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: right; margin-top: 20px">
          Forever yours,<br />Tejas
